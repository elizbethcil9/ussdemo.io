<p>When visiting Universal Studios, one of the things you cannot miss are the seven themed zones or lands available for you to explore!
<br> <br>
USS' seven zones, which are based on themes from family-friendly shows like "Sesame Street" and blockbuster flicks like "Transformers," are guaranteed to please moviegoers. Each zone has its own theme and rides, as well as retail shops and eateries. 
<br> <br>
The park's layout is circular, making it simple to move between the various zones. However, the trick is to avoid starting with the first zone you see or following the loop's order; instead, make a beeline towards the top rides on your bucket list or the inner zones to avoid lines. 
<br> <br>
Thrill seekers should head directly to <b>Ancient Egypt's</b> <b>Revenge of the Mummy</b> ride, while families with little children should head to <b>Far Far Away</b>.
